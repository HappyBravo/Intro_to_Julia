# Intro to Julia
Julia is a high-level, dynamic programming language. Its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science. Julia presents you is the option of improving the performance of your code to match those of the classic high performance languages i.e. C, C++ or Fortran, without the need to sacrifice too much time in language jargon.

- 9 Notebooks containing introduction all the presented topics
- Solutions to the small exercises in the notebooks
- Naive Prime function implementation in Julia and Python for comparison
- Naive Numerical Integration implementation in Julia and Python (which is supposed to be given as final exercise)

# How to Use Notebooks

Notebooks provides you with an interactive coding experience where you can write both code and text in the same file. Notebooks are interactive in nature what it means is that you can write a small part of your code and test if it works or not and make the necessary changes, this saves a lot of time during prototyping. There are many IDEs (Pluto.jl is a popular notebook editor used for Julia) where you can use Notebooks for this workshop we will use VS-Code.

### Using Notebooks in VS-Code for Julia
- In VS-Code `ctrl+shift p` will open the command window where you can type new notebook and select `Create: New Jupyter Notebook`.
- To run the code you need to first select a `kernel` (`Julia` in this case) you can do that by selecting the `Select kernel` on the top right of your notebook.

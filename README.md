# Intro to Julia
Julia is a high-level, dynamic programming language. Its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science.What Julia presents you is the chance of improving the performance of your code to match those of the classic high performance languages i.e. C, C++ or Fortran, without the need to sacrifice too much time in language jargon.

# Contents

- 9 Notebooks containing introduction all the presented topics
- Solutions to the small exercises in the notebooks
- Naive Prime function implementation in Julia and Python for comparison
- Naive Numerical Integration implementation in Julia and Python (which is supposed to be given as final exercise)

# How to Use Notebooks

Notebooks provides you with an interactive coding experience where you can write both code and text in the same file. Notebooks are interactive in nature what it means is that you can write a small part of your code and test if it works or not and make the necessary changes, this saves a lot of time during prototyping. We are going to use the Jupyter notebook extension in VS-Code with Julia kernel for this workshop. There are other interactive environments available like Pluto.jl which includes sliders and other more interactive options if you would like to check it out

### Using Notebooks in VS-Code for Julia
- In VS-Code `ctrl+shift p` will open the command window where you can type new notebook and select `Create: New Jupyter Notebook`.
- To run the code you need to first select a `kernel` (`Julia` in this case) you can do that by selecting the `Select kernel` on the top right of your notebook. (If you don't see `Julia` kernel in the menu you need to add the julia to the VS-Code path.)

#### Exercises and solutions
- There are small exercises at the end of each notebook. They are easy to do and should provide some experience of the material that is presented.
- The solutions to the exercises are also given, but please try to do the exercises on your own before jumping to solution.

#### Enjoy learning Julia!
